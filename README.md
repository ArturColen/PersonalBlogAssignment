## üî® Project functionality

The website consists of a personal blog that shares some personal information, data from created repositories, tips for starting in the software development field, and showcases some of my college colleagues. All this information is dynamic, meaning it is being consumed and loaded from the GitHub API and a locally created JSON Server.
